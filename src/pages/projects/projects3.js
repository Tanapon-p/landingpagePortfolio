              Why I need to create this web-app?
            </h2>
            <div className="text-xl md:text-2xl">
              &emsp; Building a basic to-do web app like Goalgrid with React.js
              is an excellent way to gain hands-on experience in web
              development. This project involves working with React components,
              state management, and user interactions, which are fundamental
              skills for web developers.
              <br />
              <br /> &emsp;Creating a Goalgrid encourages to think about
              responsive design. I can learn how to make the app look and
              function well on various devices and screen sizes, which is
              crucial in today's mobile-first world.
              <br />
              <br /> &emsp;Additionally, deploying the app to hosting services
              like Netlify offers valuable experience in setting up domains,
              configuring servers, and managing deployment pipelines. Moreover,
              it provides an opportunity to practice version control using Git
              and GitHub, fostering collaboration, branch management, and
              effective code tracking.

              &emsp;In conclusion, creating a basic to-do web app with React.js
              provided me, as an aspiring web developer, with a well-rounded
              learning experience. This project not only helped me become
              proficient in React components, state management, and user
              interaction but also exposed me to vital aspects of modern web
              development.
              <br />
              <br /> &emsp; Deploying the app to hosting services and mastering
              version control with Git and GitHub further enriched my skill set.
              Ultimately, I gained practical know-how and experience that I need
              in web development.
